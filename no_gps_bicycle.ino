Developed by Juan CerdeÃ±o on 4/24/19
Updates will be uploaded (hopefully) to www.github.com/ajuancer/door_opener
The libraries needed are listed below:
  - RCSwitch, to control the 433MHz module.
  - Software Serial, for the communication of the modules.

Obtain more details, schematics and support in the GitHub repostory www.github.com/ajuancer/door_opener

Connection to the Arduino Uno board are the follow:
 Digital pin 6   -->  Data pin of the 433MHz receiver module
Also, depending on your type of door, choose one of the follow:
 Digital pin 10  -->  Data pin of 433MHz send module
 Digital pin 11  -->  Coonected instead of the button of the cloned door remote

To facilitate the detection of errors, the integrated LED is also active when the door should open.
