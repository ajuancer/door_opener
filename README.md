# Door Opener
Make your bicycle smart! This project opens the door of your garage when you are just arriving.

The code varies depending on the door you have:
- For rolling codes, use the code of the same name.
- For static codes, use the code if the same name.
- For opening the door without needing a GPS module, use 'no_GPS'

Each one of the PDFs contains the schematic of the layout it's written in the name.
